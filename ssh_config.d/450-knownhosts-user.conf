# UserKnownHostsFile specifies one or more files to 
#    use for the user host key database, separated 
#    by whitespace.  The default is 
#    ~/.ssh/known_hosts, ~/.ssh/known_hosts2.
#
# TOKEN expansion support for UserKnownHostsFile and 
# the '%k' TOKEN for the HostKeyAlias.  This combination 
# should be an effective way to implement this in the 
# config file should you want it.
#
# For the initial pass, ssh would still always write new keys
# to .ssh/known_hosts, and only *read* from known_hosts.d; the user
# would manually split entries out into files in that directory.  Any
# change to automatically write out split files could come later.
#
# Since UserKnownHostsFile takes multiple args but only 
# writes to the first, you can now implement those 
# semantics with:
#
#  UserKnownHostsFile ~/.ssh/known_hosts ~/.ssh/known_hosts2 ~/.ssh/known_hosts.d/%k
#
# If you move the %k one to the head of the list, you'll 
# keep using the existing files for existing entries, 
# but new entries will be written to  
# ~/.ssh/known_hosts.d/ instead.
